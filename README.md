# Umbraco.GodMode
**Diplo God Mode makes Umbraco 7 developers invincible!**

This custom tree in the Developer section of Umbraco allows you to browse, query and search your document types and compositions; your templates and partials; your datatypes and property editors; your media library; your custom controllers and models.

For instance, you can:

* Quickly search doc types, templates, editors, media etc.
* Easily see which doc types inherit from any of your compositions
* See which document types use which property editor or data type instance
* See which partials are used by all your templates
* Find out which data types are being used (or not)
* View all content pages in a searchable and filterable table (using fast, server-side pagination)
* Browse all media in the Media Library and sort it by file type, size or media type
* See which controllers (Surface, API and RenderMvc) are being used and in what namespaces and DLLs
* View all generated models (that inherit from PublishedContentModel)
* Clear internal Umbraco caches and even restart App Pool
* Warm up compilation of all templates ("views") in one click
* Plus lots more!
