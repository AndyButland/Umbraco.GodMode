          Diplo God Mode makes Umbraco 7 developers invincible! This custom tree in the Developer section of Umbraco allows you to browse, query and search your document types and compositions; your templates and partials; your datatypes and property editors; your media library; your custom controllers and models.
          For instance, you can:
          * Easily see which document types inherit from any of your compositions
          * See which document types use which property editor or data type instance
          * See which partials are used by all your templates
          * Find out which data types are being used (or not)
          * Browse all media in the Media Library and sort it by file type, size or media type
          * Browse all your content in an easy-to-filter flat table
          * View all Umbraco members and filter them by assigned group
          * See content usage statistics by Content Type
          * See which controllers (Surface, API and RenderMvc) are being used and in what namespaces and DLLs
          * View all generated models (that inherit from PublishedContentModel)
          * Browse all Umbraco and server settings (including registered servers and migration history)
          * Look at all interfaces in assemblies
          * Clear the various Umbraco caches and even restart the app pool
          * Warm up the compilation of all views in a single bound... erm, click
          * Plus lots more
