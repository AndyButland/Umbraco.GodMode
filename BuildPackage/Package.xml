      <![CDATA[Diplo God Mode makes Umbraco 7 developers invincible! This custom tree in the Developer section of Umbraco allows you to browse, query and search your document types and compositions; your templates and partials; your datatypes and property editors; your media library; your custom controllers and models.
        For instance, you can:
        * Easily see which document types inherit from any of your compositions
        * See which document types use which property editor or data type instance
        * See which partials are used by all your templates
        * Find out which data types are being used (or not)
        * Browse all media in the Media Library and sort it by file type, size or media type
		* Browse all content and search and filter it
        * See which controllers (Surface, API and RenderMvc) are being used and in what namespaces and DLLs
        * View all generated models (that inherit from PublishedContentModel)
        * Clear the various Umbraco caches and even restart the app pool
        * Plus lots more]]>
