      Diplo God Mode makes Umbraco developers invincible! This custom tree in the Settings section of Umbraco 8 allows you to browse, query and search your document types and compositions; your templates and partials; your datatypes and property editors; your media library; your custom controllers and models.
      
      For instance, you can:
      
      * Easily see which document types inherit from any of your compositions
      * See which document types use which property editor or data type instance
      * See which partials are used by all your templates
      * Find out which data types are being used (or not)
      * Browse all media in the Media Library and sort it by file type, size or media type
      * Browse all your content in an easy-to-filter flat table
      * View all Umbraco members and filter them by assigned group
      * See content usage statistics by Content Type
      * See which controllers (Surface, API and RenderMvc) are being used and in what namespaces and DLLs
      * View all generated models (that inherit from PublishedContentModel)
      * Browse all Umbraco and server settings (including registered servers and migration history)
      * Look at all interfaces in assemblies
      * Clear the various Umbraco caches and even restart the app pool
      * Warm up the compilation of all views in a single bound... erm, click
      * Plus lots more
